# Shrimper Sailing League Tracker

This project is a Flask + Bootstrap skeleton for managing a sailing league. It provides the navigation and page structure described in the product spec. All pages are placeholders intended to be fleshed out with real forms and business logic.

## Development

Install dependencies and run the dev server:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask --app app run --debug
```

Routes are defined in `app/routes.py` and templates live in `app/templates`.
