  <h2>1) Handicap scoring (Personal Handicap &ldquo;PHC&rdquo;)</h2>
  <h3>What it does</h3>
  <p>Everyone has a personal handicap expressed in seconds per hour (s/hr).
     Your finish time is adjusted by this number so boats of different
     speeds can compete fairly.</p>

  <h3>How your handicap-adjusted time is calculated</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Elapsed time = Finish time &minus; Start time (in seconds).</li>
    <li>Elapsed hours = Elapsed time &divide; 3600.</li>
    <li>Handicap allowance (seconds) = Your handicap (s/hr) &times; elapsed hours.</li>
    <li>Handicap-adjusted time = Elapsed time &minus; allowance.
      <span class="text-muted">(A negative handicap reduces your time;
      a positive handicap increases it.)</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h3>How the race is ranked for results</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Boats are ordered by handicap-adjusted time (lowest is 1st).</li>
    <li>Ties on adjusted time share the same place; the next place is skipped
        (e.g., 1, 2, 2, 4&hellip;).</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Line-honours&rdquo; (absolute finishing order) is shown for interest only;
        scoring uses the handicap order.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How your handicap changes after each race</h3>
  <p>Your finishing place on handicap determines a base change to your handicap:</p>

  <div class="table-responsive mb-3">
    <table class="table table-sm table-bordered w-auto">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Place</th><th>Base change (s/hr)</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>1st</td><td>-30</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2nd</td><td>-20</td></tr>
        <tr><td>3rd</td><td>-10</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4th</td><td>0</td></tr>
        <tr><td>5th</td><td>+10</td></tr>
        <tr><td>6th</td><td>+20</td></tr>
        <tr><td>7th</td><td>+30</td></tr>
        <tr><td>8th</td><td>+40</td></tr>
        <tr><td>9th</td><td>+50</td></tr>
        <tr><td>10th or worse</td><td>+60</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Non-finishers</td><td>0</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>This base change is then scaled by fleet size (to avoid big swings in very
     small fleets):</p>

  <div class="table-responsive mb-3">
    <table class="table table-sm table-bordered w-auto">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Finishers</th><th>Scaling factor</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>1&ndash;3</td><td>0&times; (no change)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4</td><td>0.3&times;</td></tr>
        <tr><td>5</td><td>0.6&times;</td></tr>
        <tr><td>6 or more</td><td>1.0&times;</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>The actual change is the base change &times; scaling factor (rounded to the
     nearest whole second per hour).</p>
  <p>Revised handicap = Your previous handicap + actual change. This revised
     handicap becomes your starting handicap for your next race.</p>
  <p class="small"><strong>Notes:</strong> Start-of-season and new-joiner
     handicaps are set manually. Only finishers count toward the &ldquo;fleet size&rdquo;
     used for scaling.</p>
</section>

<section class="mb-4">
  <h2>2) League points (High-points system)</h2>
  <h3>What it does</h3>
  <p>Rewards higher finishing places with more points. Most points wins the
     League standings.</p>

  <h3>Per-race points</h3>
  <p>Based on your handicap finishing place:</p>

  <div class="table-responsive mb-3">
    <table class="table table-sm table-bordered w-auto">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Place</th><th>Points</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>1st</td><td>25</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2nd</td><td>18</td></tr>
        <tr><td>3rd</td><td>12</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4th</td><td>9</td></tr>
        <tr><td>5th</td><td>7</td></tr>
        <tr><td>6th</td><td>4</td></tr>
        <tr><td>7th</td><td>3</td></tr>
        <tr><td>8th</td><td>2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>9th</td><td>1</td></tr>
        <tr><td>10th or worse</td><td>0</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>These points are then scaled by the same fleet-size factor used for handicap
     adjustments:</p>

  <div class="table-responsive mb-3">
    <table class="table table-sm table-bordered w-auto">
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Finishers</th><th>Scaling factor</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>1&ndash;3</td><td>0&times; (no points awarded)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4</td><td>0.3&times;</td></tr>
        <tr><td>5</td><td>0.6&times;</td></tr>
        <tr><td>6 or more</td><td>1.0&times;</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>

  <ul>
    <li>DNF/DNS/DSQ: 0 points.</li>
    <li>Ties share the same points (competition ranking).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Series/season result</h3>
  <p>Sum your League points across the races counted for that table. Highest
     total wins (tie-breaks can be agreed by the Race Committee if needed).</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>3) Traditional points (Low-points system)</h2>
  <h3>What it does</h3>
  <p>Classic &ldquo;low-points&rdquo; scoring on handicap order. Lowest total wins.</p>

  <h3>Per-race points</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If you finish on handicap, your points equal your place (1 for 1st,
        2 for 2nd, etc.).</li>
    <li>If you do not finish (DNF/DNS/DSQ), your points are number of finishers
        + 1 for that race.</li>
    <li>Ties on handicap-adjusted time receive the same points; the next place
        is skipped (1, 2, 2, 4&hellip;).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Series/season result</h3>
  <p>For each series, total your race points to get a series score. Because
     different series may complete different numbers of races, each series
     score is adjusted according to the number of races completed in that
     series.</p>
  <p>The season grand total is the sum of these adjusted series scores; the
     lowest grand total wins (tie-breaks as per Sailing Instructions/Race
     Committee guidance).</p>
